--------ASSUMPTIONS--------

	This project assumes that:
1. VirtualBox is installed at host machine;
1. virtual machine name is "win7";
2. virtual machine guest OS will login automatically, without password or login selection;
3. virtual machine will complete booting in 3 minutes;

	All three parameters defined as constants at the beginning of main function. Virtual machine name also can be set via run parameter.


--------DEBUG AND RELEASE CONFIGURATIONS--------

	In Release configuration program will hide:
- itself from the screen;
- itself from running application list;
- virtual machine from the screen;
- virtual machine from running application list;
However, all processes created by program will be visible in 'Processes' tab in Windows Task Manager.

	To watch the VM's guest operating system state in Release configuration, you can launch VirtualBox Manager, select virtual machine from the list and take a look at the 'Preview' panel at the right of the window. Picture there will refresh once a second. To shutdown virtual machine you can go to VirtualBox manager main menu and select Machine -> Close -> Power Off.

	In Debug configuration nothing will be suppressed and extra messages will be shown in console window for debugging purposes.


--------SOFTWARE--------

	Both host and guest operating systems in my tests was freshly installed Windows 7 Professional SP1 (32-bit). VirtualBox version was 4.3.20. Project was made in Visual Studio 2012 11.0 Visual C++ environment.
